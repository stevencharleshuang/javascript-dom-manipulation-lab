## Learning Objectives

- Manipulate the DOM.

## Introduction

Can you really **manipulate** the DOM, though?

Didn't think so. Thankfully, we're not talking about **that** Dom.

Today, we'll be practicing DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Set Up

You've been provided with a basic website, including the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files. All of your work will go in the `script.js` file â€” you shouldn't have to edit `index.html` or `style.css`.

There are empty functions for each part. Don't forget to **call** the function to test its utility.

## Completion

Finish filling out all of the functions set up in `script.js`.

## Resources
